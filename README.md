## Description:
Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) enables you to launch Amazon Web Services resources into a virtual network you've defined. This virtual network resembles a traditional network that you'd operate in your own data center, with the benefits of using the scalable infrastructure of AWS.

A Terraform module is a collection of standard configuration files in a dedicated directory. Terraform modules encapsulate groups of resources dedicated to one task, reducing the amount of code you have to develop for similar infrastructure components.
